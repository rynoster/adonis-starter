### Disclaimer

This is my personal Adonis starter site with all the basic things I need to get started for most of my apps.
Although all care has been taken to implement this according to the best of my ability, I do not intend to maintain this other than for myself, use at your own risk and discretion.
Constructive criticism is always welcome and appreciated.

A lot of code was taken from the AdonisJs 4.0 series by Traversy Media. I have made some slight changes in certain areas.
If you are new to AdonisJs, I recommend watching the series at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oXpBK2iNQU

### Documentation

Most of the code used in this repo is based on the documentation provided on the AdonisJs website. It is really some of the best documentation I have seen for a framework, not just in content, but also in the flow and structure of it.

Please refer to the documentation if you get stuck or need reference - https://adonisjs.com/docs/4.1/installation
